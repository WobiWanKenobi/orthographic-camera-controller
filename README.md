## ðŸ“¸ About

This is an orthographic camera controller for the unity game engine, that can be used either with orthographic cameras or perspective cameras.

### ðŸ”§ Configuration

To set up the camera controller you need to create a new "empty game object" as camera rig, set it's x and z position to any value that suits your starting position and the y rotation to 45 degree.
After that create a new camera as child of your camera rig game object and set it's y position value to any value that suits your scene. Important is to not forget setting the x rotation value of your camera to 45 degree. After that you can specify all the other parameters to your liking!

Here is a sample setup with screenshots from my game

### ðŸŽ® Controls

  <li>Turn Camera by 90Â°: Q, E</li>
